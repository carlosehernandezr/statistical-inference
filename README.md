# Statistical Inference Course Project

The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.

In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.

2. Basic inferential data analysis.

Now in the second portion of the project, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
